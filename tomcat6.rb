  def caveats; <<-EOS.undent
    Some of the support scripts used by Tomcat have very generic names.
    These are likely to conflict with support scripts used by other Java-based
    server software.

    You can link Tomcat into PATH with:

      brew link tomcat6

    or add #{bin} to your PATH instead.
