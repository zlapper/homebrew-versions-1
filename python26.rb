Options
-------
There are a few options for customzing the build.
  --universal: Builds combined 32-/64-bit Intel binaries.
  --framework: Builds a "Framework" version of Python.
  --static:    Builds static instead of shared libraries.

site-packages
-------------
The "site-packages" folder lives in the Cellar, under the "lib" folder
for normal builds, and under the "Frameworks" folder for Framework builds.

A .pth file is added to the Cellar site-packages that adds the corresponding
HOMEBREW_PREFIX folder (/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages by default)
to sys.path. Note that this alternate folder doesn't itself support .pth files.

pip / distribute
----------------
The pip (and distribute) formulae in Homebrew are designed only to work
against a Homebrew-installed Python, though they provide links for
manually installing against a custom Python.

pip and distribute are installed directly into the Cellar site-packages,
since they need to install to a place that supports .pth files.

The pip & distribute formuale use the "site_packages" method defined here
to get the appropriate site-packages path.

      Framework Python was installed to:
        #{prefix}/Frameworks/Python.framework

      You may want to symlink this Framework to a standard OS X location,
      such as:
        mkdir ~/Frameworks
        ln -s "#{prefix}/Frameworks/Python.framework" ~/Frameworks

    EOS

    site_caveats = <<-EOS.undent
      The site-packages folder for this Python is:
        #{site_packages}

      We've added a "homebrew.pth" file to also include:
        #{prefix_site_packages}

    EOS

    general_caveats = <<-EOS.undent
      You may want to create a "virtual environment" using this Python as a base
      so you can manage multiple independent site-packages. See:
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv

      If you install Python packages via pip, binaries will be installed under
      Python's cellar but not automatically linked into the Homebrew prefix.
      You may want to add Python's bin folder to your PATH as well:
        #{bin}
